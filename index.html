                <h2>fast and furious</h2>
                <p>
                    The original 2001 movie in the now seven-part action series was inspired by a 1998 Vibe magazine article. The piece, titled “Racer X” and written by Kenneth LiRafael, discussed the illegal street racing culture in the late ‘90s in New York City. The movie became a commercial hit, earning $207.3 million at the box office. It also went on to spur one of the most popular and highest-grossing franchises of all time – one that grossed a total of $3.5 billion worldwide and inspired two short films, as well as a video game series. As the franchise’s star Vin Diesel recently confirmed, the next installment, Fast and Furious 8, is already in development and is expected to hit theaters in April 2017.

                <h2>argo</h2>
                <p>
                    The 2012 political thriller, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, used Joshuah Bearman’s 2007 Wired article The Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran as one of its source materials for adaptations. The piece discusses the event known as the “Canadian Caper,” in which CIA operative Tony Mendez led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis. Argo earned $232.3 million at the box office. It also received widespread acclaim and won three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.

                <h2>Boogie Nights</h2>
                <p>
                    Director Paul Thomas Anderson cited the 1989 Rolling Stone article, “The Devil and John Holmes,” written by Mike Sager, as a huge influence for his 1997 movie, Boogie Nights. The original article follows the story of porn star John Holmes as he spirals into a world of drug abuse and possible involvement in the 1981 Wonderland murders. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a young nightclub dishwasher who becomes a popular star of pornographic films, chronicling his rise in the Golden Age of Porn of the 1970s and his eventual fall in the ’80s.
